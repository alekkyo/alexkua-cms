# alexkuaCMS

The CMS that I use for my clients when developing websites for them. It's goal is to be as simple and intuitive as possible for the user, as well as being visually appealing and informative.

The application uses Laravel 5.6 PHP Framework.
## Users
There are 3 types of users using the CMS:

###### Super Admin
This user can do everything in the CMS, including restarting setup and managing admins.
###### Admin
This user can create new pages, arrange the menu and manage users.
###### User
This user can only edit content and upload images.
